# app_uidesign

This is a dashboard app type Flutter project inspired in the dashboard app project from Mitch Koko, https://github.com/mitchkoko/responsivedashboard.git.

## Getting Started

This project is a dashboard app for a Flutter application.

With the base code from Mitch Koko we adapted it so it shows 4 cards, one for each of our sensors to display the measurement from our smartwatch device and send notifications from the cloud in case the out of the norm data is percieved.
